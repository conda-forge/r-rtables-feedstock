  summary: Reporting tables often have structure that goes beyond simple rectangular data. The
    'rtables' package provides a framework for declaring complex multi-level tabulations
    and then applying them to data. This framework models both tabulation and the resulting
    tables as hierarchical, tree-like objects which support sibling sub-tables, arbitrary
    splitting or grouping of data in row and column dimensions, cells containing multiple
    values, and the concept of contextual summary computations. A convenient pipe-able
    interface is provided for declaring table layouts and the corresponding computations,
    and then applying them to data.
